# 🦾 Robotic Arm Angle Calculator

A Python-based tool developed to calculate the necessary servo angles for a 3D robotic arm to reach specific coordinate.

## 🚀 Features
- Uses math to determine angles for servos.
- Built-in **custom error handling** for unreachable target coordinates.
- Designed for integration into 3D robotic systems.
- Visualizer (2D): use PS5 controller to controll an arm!
## 🛠️ How it Works
The script takes the lengths of the upper and lower arm segments and the $(x, y)$ target tip. It then outputs the degrees required for the servos.

## 📈 Hack Club Progress
- **Goal:** Bambu Lab A1 Mini (105 Hours)
- **Status:** Currently in very early development.
